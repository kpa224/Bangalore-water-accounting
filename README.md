# Bangalore-water-accounting
The program generates a sankey diagram for the water accounting in Bangalore


Important note:
1. Ensure that the js file(sankey.js) is in the same folder, as of the HTML file. Since the online link to the js is broken and we have given the local link.
2. The sequence of the links in the csv file is hard coded, and thus you need to edit the value in the csv file(final-links.csv) without altering the sequence
3. Flow value for each flow must be strictly non-zero, else the diagram is showing some error which we are unable to figure out.
